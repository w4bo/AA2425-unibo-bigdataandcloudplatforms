DBMSs\n\n# Not only SQL\n\n# Introduction\n\nWhat is NoSQL\n\nWhere does it come from, and why\n\n# Strengths of RDBMSs\n\n* _ACID properties_\n  * Provides guarantees in terms of consistency and concurrent accesses\n* _Data integration and normalization of schemas_\n  * Several application can share and reuse the same information\n* _Standard model and query language_\n  * The relational model and SQL are very well-known standards\n  * The same theoretical background is shared by the different implementations\n* _Robustness_\n  * Have been used for over 40 years\n\n# Weaknesses of RDBMS\n\n* Impedance mismatch\n  * Data are stored according to the relational model, but applications to modify them typically rely on the object-oriented model\n  * Many solutions, no standard\n    * E.g.: Object Oriented DBMS (OODBMS), Object-Relational DBMS (ORDBMS), Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks\n* _Painful scaling-out_\n  * Not suited for a cluster architecture\n  * Distributing an RDBMS is neither easy nor cheap (e.g., Oracle RAC)\n* _Consistency vs latency_\n  * Consistency is a must – even at the expense of latency\n  * Today's applications require high reading/writing throughput with low latency\n* _Schema rigidity_\n  * Schema evolution is often expensive\n\n# What NoSQL means\n\n* The term has been first used in '98 by Carlo Strozzi\n  * It referred to an open-source RDBMS that used a query language different from SQL\n* In 2009 it was adopted by a meetup in San Francisco\n  * Goal: discuss open-source projects related to the newest databases from Google and Amazon\n  * Participants: Voldemort, Cassandra, Dynomite, HBase, Hypertable, CouchDB, MongoDB\n* Today, _NoSQL_ indicates _DBMSs_ adopting a _different data model from the relational one_\n  * NoSQL = Not Only SQL\n  * According to Strozzi himself, NoREL would have been a more proper noun\n\n# The first NoSQL systems\n\n* _LiveJournal, 2003_\n  * Goal: reduce the number of queries on a DB from a pool of web servers\n  * Solution: _Memcached_ , designed to keep queries and results in RAM\n* _Google, 2005_\n  * Goal: handle Big Data (web indexing, Maps, Gmail, etc.)\n  * Solution: _BigTable_ , designed for scalability and high performance on Petabytes of data\n* _Amazon, 2007_\n  * Goal: ensure availability and reliability of its e-commerce service 24/7\n  * Solution: _DynamoDB_ , characterized by strong simplicity for data storage and manipulation\n\n---\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal LiveJournal è una sorta di MSN russo\n\n# NoSQL common features\n\n* Not just rows and tables\n  * Several data model adopted to store and manipulate data\n* Freedom from joins\n  * Joins are either not supported or discouraged\n* Freedom from rigid schemas\n  * Data can be stored or queried without pre-defining a schema (_schemaless_ _ or _soft-schema_)\n* Distributed, shared-nothing architecture\n  * Trivial scalability in a distributed environment with no performance decay\n  * Each workstation uses its own disks and RAM\n* SQL is dead, long live SQL!\n  * Some systems do adopt SQL (or a SQL-like language)\n\n# NoSQL in the Big Data world\n\n* _NoSQL_ systems are mainly used for operational workloads (_OLTP_)\n  * Optimized for high read and write throughput on small amounts of data\n* _Big Data _ technologies are mainly used for analytical workloads (_OLAP_)\n  * Optimized for high read throughput on large amounts of data\n* Can NoSQL systems be used for OLAP?\n  * Possibly, but through Big Data analytical tools (e.g., Spark)\n\n---\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/it/nosql/\n\n# Data models\n\n# NoSQL: several data models\n\nOne of the key challenges is to understand which one fits best with the required application\n\n| Model | Description | Use cases |\n|:-: |:-: |:-: |\n| Key-value | Associates any kind of value to a string | Dictionary, lookup table, cache, file and images storage |\n| Document | Stores hierarchical data in a tree-like structure | Documents, anything that fits into a hierarchical structure |\n| Wide-column | Stores sparse matrixes where a cell is identified by the row and column keys

 * E.g.: people, organizations, web pages, workstations, cells, books, etc.\n  * Arcs: represent directed relationships between the vertices\n    * E.g.: friendship, work relationship, hyperlink, ethernet links, copyright, etc.\n  * Vertices and arcs are described by _properties_\n  * Arcs are stored as physical pointers\n* Most known specializations:\n  * Reticular data model\n    * Parent-child or owner-member relationships\n  * Triplestore\n    * Subject-predicate-object relationships (e.g., RDF)\n\n![](imgs/slides72.png)\n\n---\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5040617/what-is-the-difference-between-a-graph-database-and-a-network-database\n\n# Graph: querying\n\n* Graph databases usually model relationships-rich scenarios\n* The query language simplifies the navigation of these relationships\n  * Support for transactions\n  * Support for indexes, selections and projections\n  * __Query language based on detecting patterns__\n\n| Query | Pattern |\n|:-: |:-: |\n| Find friends of friends | (user)-[:KNOWS]-(friend)-[:KNOWS]-(foaf) |\n| Find shortest path from A to B |

intrinsically different from the others\n  * Focused on the relationships rather than on the entities per-se\n  * __Limited scalability__: it is often impossible to shard a graph on several machines without \"cutting\" several arcs (i.e. having several cross-machine links)\n    * Batch cross-machine queries: don’t follow relationships one by one, but \"group them\" to make less requests\n    * Limit the depth of cross-machine node searches\n  * _Data-driven modeling_\n* Key-value, document and wide-column are called _aggregate-oriented_\n  * Aggregate = key-value pair, document, row (respectively)\n  * The aggregate is the atomic block (no guarantees for multi-aggregate operations)\n* Based on the concept of encapsulation\n  * Avoid joins as much as possible  achieve __high

handled as a block\n  * Aggregates are the basic unit for data manipulation and consistency management\n* Advantages\n  * _Can be distributed trivially_\n    * Data that should be used together (e.g., orders and details) are stored together\n  * _Facilitate the developer's job_\n    * By surpassing the impedance mismatch problem\n* Disadvantages\n  * __No design strategy exists for aggregates__\n    * _It only depends on how they are meant to be used_\n  * Can optimize only a limited set of queries\n  * Data denormalization  possible inconsistencies\n* RDBMSs are agnostic from this point of view\n\n# Sharding data\n\nA look behind the curtain\n\n* One of the strengths of NoSQL systems is their _scale-out capability_\n  * _ _Aggregate data modeling_ _: _ well suited for being distributed within a cluster\n  * NoSQL systems can be used in a _single server environment _ too\n    * Graph databases do not scale as well as the others\n* Two aspects must be considered when deploying on a cluster\n  * __Sharding__: _distributing the data across different nodes_\n  * __Replication__: _creating copies of the data on several nodes_\n\n---\n\nAs data volumes increase, it becomes more difficult and expensive to\nscale up—buy a bigger server to run the database on. A more appealing option is to\nscale out—run the database on a cluster of servers. Aggregate orientation fits well\nwith scaling out because the aggregate is a natural unit to use for distribution.\n\nQuando ha senso l’approccio single-server?\nMole di dati non è enorme \nSi vogliono sfruttare le caratteristiche dei database NoSQL (e.g., schemaless, modello dati)\nUn sistema distribuito è inevitabilmente più complesso; non è detto che ne valga sempre la pena\n\n\n# Sharding\n\n* __Sharding__: _subdividing the data in _ _shards_ _ that are stored in different machines_\n  * Intrinsic in a distributed DB\n  * Improves the efficiency of the system\n    * Read/write operations are distributed\n* A good _sharding_ _ strategy _ is __fundamental __ to optimize performances\n  * Usually based on one or more fields composing the sharding key\n\n![](imgs/slides81.png)\n\n---\n\nRimosso: Non dimenticarsi che, nei cluster,si usano macchine meno affidabili – diminuisce la resistenza ai guasti\n\n\n# Sharding strategy\n\n* Thumbs-up rules for a sharding strategy:\n* _ Data-locality: stores the data close to those that need to access them_\n  * E.g., store orders of Italian customers in the European data center\n* _ Keep a balanced distribution_\n  * Each node should have the same percentage of data (more or less)\n* _ Keep together the data that must be accessed together_\n  * E.g., store each client’s orders in the same node\n\n* Hash strategy: a hash function is used to allocate data to partitions\n  * Adopted by DynamoDB and Cassandra\n  * Pro: ensures even data distribution across nodes  massive scalability\n  * Pro: new nodes can be added without heavy data redistribution\n  * Con: range queries become inefficient\n\n![](imgs/slides82.png)\n\n---\n\nhttps://blog.yugabyte.com/four-data-sharding-strategies-we-analyzed-in-building-a-distributed-sql-database/\n\n* Range strategy: each partition contains a range of sorted data\n  * Adopted by HBase\n  * Pro: efficiently run range queries that work on the sharding key values\n  * Con: global ordering often generates hot spots  risk of bottlenecks\n  * Con: ranges are defined a priori and this can determine heavy data redistribution\n\n![](imgs/slides83.png)\n\n---\n\nhttps://blog.yugabyte.com/four-data-sharding-strategies-we-analyzed-in-building-a-distributed-sql-database/\n\nAuto-sharding: the database distributes the data according to the workload\n\nBeware: redefining (or choosing later) the sharding strategy can be quite expensive\n\n![](imgs/slides84.png)\n\n# Replication\n\n* __Replication__: the data is _copied _ on several nodes\n  * Improves the robustness of the system\n    * In case of node failure, replicas prevent data loss\n  * Improves the efficiency of the system\n    * More users read the same data from different copies, in parallel\n    * Higher chance of enforcing data-locality\n* How to distribute the replicas?\n  * Random (possibly _topology-aware_) distribution of each record\n    * Similarly to HDFS blocks\n  * Replication of entire instances\n* Main issue: each update must be pushed to every replica\n  * Two techniques to handle updates: master-slave, peer to peer\n\n---\n\nParliamo di replica completa, per ora\n\n# Master-Slave Replication\n\n* _Master_\n  * It’s the manager of the data\n  * _Handles each and every write operation_\n  * Can be chosen or drawn\n* _Slaves _\n  * Enable read operations\n  * In sync with the master\n  * Can become masterif the latter fails\n\n![](imgs/slides85.png)\n\n---\n\nParliamo di replica completa, per ora\n\n* __Pros__\n  * Easily handles many read requests\n    * Slaves do not need the master to perform reads\n  * Useful when the workload mainly consists of reads\n  * Useful to avoid write conflicts\n* __Cons__\n  * _The master is a bottleneck_\n    * __Only the master can handle writes__\n    * In case of failure, a new master must be drawn\n  * Delay in write propagation can be a source of inconsistency\n    * Two users may read different values at the same time\n    * _Read inconsistency can be problematic, but are relatively limited in time_\n  * Not ideal when the workload mainly consists of writes\n\n# Peer-to-Peer Replication\n\nEach node has the same importance\n\n_Each node can handle write operations_\n\nThe loss of a node does not compromise reads nor writes\n\n![](imgs/slides86.png)\n\n* __Pro__\n  * The failure of a node does not interrupt read nor write requests\n  * Write performances easily scale by adding new nodes\n* __Cons__\n  * _Conflicts! _\n  * Delay in write propagation can be a source of inconsistency\n    * Same as with master-slave replication\n  * Two users may update the same value from different replicas\n    * _Write inconsistencies are way worse_\n\n---\n\nTODO: come gestire conflitti in scrittura?

Does session management storage need the same rigorous backup/recovery strategy as the e-commerce orders data? Does the session management storage need more availability of an instance of database engine to write/read session data?\n\nIn 2006, Neal Ford coined the term polyglot programming, to express the idea that applications should be written in a mix of languages to take advantage of the fact that different languages are suitable for tackling different problems. Complex applications combine different types of problems, so picking the right language for each job may be more productive than trying to fit all aspects into a single language.\n\n\n# Polyglot data management\n\nThe _one-size-fits-all_ solution\n\nReplaced by the _polyglot _ solution\n\n![](imgs/slides92.png)\n\n---\n\nA key-value data store could be used to store the shopping cart data before the order is confirmed by the customer and also store the session data so that the RDBMS is not used for this transient data. Key-value stores make sense here since the shopping cart is usually accessed by user ID and, once confirmed and paid by the customer, can be saved in the RDBMS. Similarly, session data is keyed by the session ID. If we need to recommend products to customers when they place products into their shopping carts—for example, “ your friends also bought these products” or “ your friends bought these accessories for this product”—then introducing a graph data store in the mix becomes relevant.\n\nEven using specialized relational databases for different purposes, such as data warehousing appliances or analytics appliances within the same application, can be viewed as polyglot persistence\n\n\n\n# Service-oriented polyglot data management\n\n* Each DB should be \"embedded\" within services, which offer API services to enable data access and manipulation\n  * Several NoSQL systems (e.g., Riak, Neo4J) already provide REST APIs\n\n![](imgs/slides93.png)\n\n# Supporting existing technologies\n\nIf the current solution cannot be changed, NoSQL systems can still support the existing ones\n\n![](imgs/slides94.png)\n\n---\n\nWhile doing this, we need to update the indexed data as the data in the application database changes. The process of updating the data can be real-time or batch, as long as we ensure that the application can deal with stale data in the index/search engine. The event sourcing (“ Event Sourcing,” p. 142) pattern can be used to update the index.\n\n# Beyond NoSQL\n\n* NewSQL systems\n  * Combine the benefits from both relational and NoSQL worlds\n  * Ensure scalability without compromising consistency, but by __compromising some availability__\n* Extended RDBMSs\n  * KV implementable as a table with two fields: a string key, and a blob value\n  * Cypher query language on top of a relational implementation of a graph\n  * Hstore data type in PostgreSQL for wide-column-like implementation\n  * __Scalabilty__ __ issue remains__\n* Multi-model NoSQL DBMSs\n  * ArangoDB, OrientDB\n  * __Support all NoSQL data models, but not the relational one__\n* Database-as-a-service\n  * All cloud providers offer storage services supporting all data models\n\n# -- newsection --\n\n# Cloud computing\n\n# \n\n![](imgs/slides95.png)\n\n[https://xkcd.com/1444/](https://xkcd.com/1444/)\n\n# Reference scenario\n\n* The big-data cube\n  * Volume: small to big\n  * Variety: structure to unstructured\n  * Velocity: pull to push\n\nMeijer, Erik. \"Your mouse is a database.\"  _Communications of the ACM_ 55.5 (2012): 66-73.\n\n* __Variety__\n  * __Structured__\n    * Relational tuples with FK/PK relationships\n  * __Unstructured__\n    * Key-value\n    * Columnar\n    * Document-based\n    * Graph\n    * ...\n\n![](imgs/slides96.png)\n\n![](imgs/slides97.png)\n\n[https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data/](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data/) (accessed 2022-08-01)\n\n* __Velocity__ (latency)\n  * __High__: clients synchronously pulling data from sources\n  * __Low__: sources asynchronously pushing data to clients\n* __Velocity__ (speed;

When we have too little, we draw power from the local grid, and that power may not be renewable.\n\n\n# \n\n![](imgs/slides107.png)\n\n[https://xkcd.com/908/](https://xkcd.com/908/)\n\n# Cloud computing: types of cloud\n\n* There are different types of cloud\n  * __Public__: accessible to anyone willing to pay (e.g., Microsoft, AWS, Google)\n  * __Private__: accessible by individuals within an institution\n    * In public cloud, any resources that you are not using can be used by other\n    * Users share the costs\n    * Cost-sharing disappears in private clouds\n  * __Hybrid__: a mix of the previous\n\n![](imgs/slides108.png)\n\n* Cloud services are hosted in separate geographic areas\n  * Locations are composed of __regions__ and __availability zones__\n* Region (e.g., us-east-1)\n  * Is an independent geographical area that groups data centers\n  * Has availability zones\n* Availability zones in a region\n  * A data center\n  * Connected through low-latency links\n  * Resources are usually replicated across zones but not regions\n\n![](imgs/slides109.png)\n\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html)\n\n# Cloud computing: principal vendors\n\n![](imgs/slides110.png)\n\n* Gartner Magic Quadrant\n  * Understanding the technology providers to consider for an investment\n  * __Leaders__ execute well and are well positioned for tomorrow\n  * __Visionaries__ understand where the market is going but do not yet execute well\n  * __Niche Players__ focus successfully on a small segment, or are unfocused and do not out-innovate or outperform others\n  * __Challengers__ execute well but do not demonstrate an understanding of market direction\n  * Focusing on leaders isn’t always the best\n    * A niche player may support needs better than a market leader.

models\n\n* On a cloud architecture, you can rely on _serverless_ or _managed _ services\n* _Serverless_\n  * Standalone independent services built for a specific purpose and integrated by cloud service provider\n  * No visibility into the machines\n    * There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away\n    * No server management, do not have to manage any servers or scale them\n    * E.g., when you run a query on [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/bigquery/separation-of-storage-and-compute-in-bigquery) you do not know how many machines were used\n  * Pay for what your application uses, usually per request or per usage\n* _(Fully) Managed_\n  * Visibility and control of machines\n    * You can choose the number of machines that are being used to run your application\n  * Do not have to set up any machines, the management and backup are taken care for you\n  * Pay for machine runtime, however long you run the machines and resources that your application uses\n\n[https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/serverless-vs-fully-managed-whats-difference](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/serverless-vs-fully-managed-whats-difference)

deliver to users\n\n![](imgs/slides111.png)\n\n* __On-premises__\n  * Provisioning servers is time-consuming\n    * A non-trivial environment is hard to set up\n  * Require dedicated operations people\n  * Often a distraction from strategic tasks\n\n* __Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)__\n  * A computing infrastructure provisioned and managed over the internet (e.g., AWS EC2)\n  * Avoid expense/complexity of buying/managing physical servers/data-centers\n  * IaaS overcomes issues on-premises\n  * Possibly requires to manage many environments\n\n* __Platform as a Service (PaaS)__\n  * A development and deployment environment in the cloud (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk)\n  * Support complete application life-cycle: building, testing, deploying, etc.\n  * Avoid expense/complexity of managing licenses and application infrastructure\n\n* __PaaS__ and __containers__ are potential solutions to inconsistent infrastructures\n* PaaS provides a platform for users to run their software\n  * Developers write software targeting features/capabilities of the platform\n* Containerization isolates an application with its own environment\n  * Lightweight alternative to full virtualization\n  * Containers are isolated but need to be deployed to (public/private) server\n  * Excellent solution when dependencies are in play\n  * Housekeeping challenges and complexities\n\n* _Containers_ and _virtual machines _ are packaged computing environments\n* _Containers_\n  * On top of physical server and its host OS\n  * Share the host OS kernel\n  * Shared components are read-only\n  * “Light”,

__)__\n  * A coding environment, cloud provider provisions platform to run the code (e.g., AWS Lambda)\n  * Infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer\n\n* Principles of FaaS architectures\n  * FaaS is based on a serverless approach, use a compute service to execute code on demand\n  * Every function could be considered as a standalone service\n  * Write single-purpose stateless functions\n* Functions react to events\n  * Design push-based, event-driven pipelines\n  * Create thicker, more powerful front ends\n  * Embrace third-party services (e.g., security)\n* FaaS is not a silver bullet\n  * Not appropriate for latency-sensitive applications\n  * Strict specific service-level agreements\n  * Migration costs\n  * Vendor lock-in can be an issue\n\n* __Software as a service (SaaS)__\n  * An application environment\n  * Access cloud-based apps over the Internet (e.g., email, Microsoft Office 365, Github)\n\n#

If the step fails, the transaction can be retried; depending on the query’s semantics (optimistic concurrency)\n  * Optionally, write a new .parquet checkpoint for log record r+1\n* Creating the r+1 .json record, needs to be atomic: only 1 client should succeed. Not all large-scale storage systems have an atomic put operation\n  * Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Store support atomic put-if-absent operations\n  * HDFS, we use atomic renames to rename a temporary file to the target name\n  * Amazon S3 need ad-hoc protocols\n\n# Lakehouse\n\n* (SQL) Format-independent optimizations are\n  * __Caching__: When using a transactional metadata layer such as Delta Lake, it is safe for a Lakehouse system to cache files from the cloud object store on faster storage devices such as SSDs and RAM on the processing nodes\n  * __Auxiliary data__: maintain column min-max statistics for each data file in the table within the same Parquet file used to store the transaction log, which enables data skipping optimizations when the base data is clustered by particular columns\n  * __Data layout__:\n    * Record ordering: which records are clustered together and hence easiest to read together, e.g. ordering records using individual dimensions or space-filling curves such as Z-order\n    * Compression strategies differently for various groups of records, or other strategies\n* Offer a declarative version of the DataFrame APIs which maps data preparation computations into Spark SQL query plans and can benefit from logical optimizations\n\n# -- newsection --\n\n# Data pipelines on cloud (Computing)\n\n# \n\nSupporting services\n\nServe

Most seeds develop herbicide-resistant properties, rendering pesticides ineffective. Mechanical automatic systems that are studied as alternatives to pesticides deteriorate soil features, damage beneficial soil organisms and offer limited results for in-row weeding. The EU-funded WeLASER project will develop a non-chemical solution for weed management based on pioneering technology consisting of the application of lethal doses of energy on the weed meristems through a high-power laser source. An AI-vision system separates crops from weeds, identifying the weed meristems and pointing the laser at them. A smart controller based on IoT and cloud computing techniques coordinates the system, which is _ _transfered_ _ all over the field by an autonomous vehicle._\n\n![](imgs/slides348.png)\n\n[https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101000256](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101000256) (accessed 2020-08-01)\n\n* Which requirements do you foresee?\n*

O'Reilly Media, Inc.\", 2014.\n\n* General idea:\n  * Collect events from many source systems\n  * Store them in a unified log\n  * Enable applications to operate on these event streams\n* __Unified log__\n  * _Unified_ , _append-only_ , _ordered_ , _distributed_ log that allows the centralization of event streams\n\n![](imgs/slides359.jpg)\n\n* __Unified__: a single log in a company with applications sending/reading events\n  * Log serves as central data backbone\n    * It can contain many distinct continuous streams of events\n    * Not all events are sent to the same event stream\n* __Append-only__: new events are appended to the unified log\n  * Existing events are never updated in place\n    * If read the event \\#10, never look at events 1 through 10 again\n  * Events are automatically deleted from the unified log when they age\n    * E.g., automatically remove events after 7 days\n\n* __Distributed__: the unified log lives across a cluster of machines\n  * Optionally divide events into shards (i.e., partitions)Still, the log is unified since we have a single (conceptual) log\n* Distribution ensures\n  * Scalability: work with streams larger than the capacity of single machines\n  * Durability: replicate all events within the cluster to overcome data loss\n  * Using a log as a universal integration mechanism is never going to be more than an elegant fantasy if we can’t build a log that is fast, cheap, and scalable\n\n![](imgs/slides360.jpg)\n\n* __Ordered__: events in a shard have a sequential IDs (unique in a shard)\n  * Local ordering keeps things much simpler than global ordering\n  * Applications maintain their own cursor for each shard\n\n![](imgs/slides361.jpg)\n\nLamport, Leslie. \"Time, clocks, and the ordering of events in a distributed system.\"  _Concurrency: the Works of Leslie _ _Lamport_ . 2019. 179-196.\n\n* Two types of processing\n  * __Single-event:__ a single event produces zero or more events\n    * Validating “Does this event contain all the required fields?”\n    * Enriching “Where is this IP address located?”\n    * Filtering “Is this error critical?”\n  * __Multiple-event:__ multiple events collectively produce zero or more events\n    * Aggregating, functions such as minimum, maximum, sum\n    * Pattern matching, looking for patterns or co-occurrence\n    * Reordering events based on a sort key\n\n![](imgs/slides362.png)\n\n* Why not communicating directly using messaging protocols?\n* A log enables\n  * Multi-subscriber: each data item is available to any processor that wants it\n  * Order: maintained in the processing done by each consumer of data\n  * Buffering and isolation to the individual processes\n    * E.g., a that processor produces faster than its downstream consumer can keep up\n  * Reprocessing, maintaining state, etc.\n* Indeed, logs are common:\n  * MapReduce workflows use files to checkpoint and share their intermediate results\n  * SQL processing pipelines create intermediate or temporary tables\n\n# Ingestion: stream (AWS)\n\n* Amazon Kinesis Data Streams\n  * Created and provisioned by shard\n    * Each shard provides 1 MBps and 1000 data puts per second\n  * A data record consists of\n    * User-supplied partition key to balance records across shards\n    * Incremental sequence number added by the shard\n    * A data blob\n  * Consumers get records by shard\n    * Records are sorted by partition key and sequence number\n    * Ordering is not guaranteed across shards\n  * Records are retained for 7 days at maximum\n\n![](imgs/slides363.png)\n\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/key-concepts.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/key-concepts.html)\n\n* Re-sharding (i.e., scaling)\n  * Split a shard into two, or merge two shards\n  * Users must scale shards up and down manually\n    * Monitor usage with Amazon CloudWatch and modify scale as needed\n  * Avoid shard management by using Kinesis Data Firehose\n* Kinesis is a regional service, with streams scoped to specific regions\n  * All ingested data must travel to the region in which the stream is defined\n* Costs\n  * Priced by shard hour, data volume, and data retention period\n  * Pay for resources you provision (even if not used)\n\n[https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)[https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose)\n\n# Ingestion:

functions in a loose orchestration\n  * Build modular back-end systems\n  * Event-driven and push-based pipelines\n* With Lambda, you are responsible only for your code (Lambda function)\n  * Lambda manages the compute fleet that offers a balance of memory and CPU\n  * Lambda performs operational and administrative activities on your behalf\n    * Provisioning capacity, monitoring fleet health, applying security patches, etc.\n\n![](imgs/slides364.png)\n\n# Serverless computing (AWS Lambda)\n\n* AWS Lambda\n  * A Lambda function is a granular service\n  * The Lambda runtime invokes a lambda function multiple times in parallel\n  * Compute service that executes code written in JavaScript/Python/C\\#/Java\n    * Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) servers run the code (e.g., a Linux server)\n  * A function is `code + configuration + dependencies`\n    * Source code (JARs or DLLs) is zipped up and deployed to a container\n  * Invocation supports push/pull events\n\n![](imgs/slides365.png)\n\n# Serverless computing (FaaS)\n\n* FaaS: write single-purpose stateless functions\n  * Keep the single responsibility principle in mind\n  * A function that does just one thing is more testable and robust\n  * A function with a well-defined interface is also more likely to be reused\n  * Code should be created in a stateless style\n    * Statelessness allows scalability\n    * Local resources or processes will not survive along sessions\n  * Functions that terminate sooner are cheaper\n    * E.g., pricing is based on \\#requests, execution time, and allocated memory\n\n# Patterns for data pipelines\n\n* Patterns are architectural solutions to problems in software design\n  * A (design) pattern is a general, best-practice reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design\n  * It is a template for how to solve a problem in many different situations\n* Patterns for serverless data pipelines\n    * Command pattern\n    * Messaging pattern\n    * Priority queue pattern\n    * Pipes and filters pattern\n\n![](imgs/slides366.jpg)\n\n[https://www.manning.com/books/aws-lambda-in-action](https://www.manning.com/books/aws-lambda-in-action)\n\n# Command pattern\n\n* Command pattern\n  * A behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate the information needed to perform an action or trigger an event\n* Encapsulate a request as an object\n  * Issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the operation being requested or the receiver\n\n![](imgs/slides367.png)\n\n[https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway)\n\n# Pipes and filters pattern\n\n* Decompose a complex processing task into a sequence of manageable services\n  * Components designed to transform data are referred to as filters\n  * Connectors that pass data between components are referred to as pipes\n\n![](imgs/slides368.png)\n\n# Messaging pattern\n\n* Messaging pattern\n  * Describes how two different parts of a message passing system connect and communicate with each other\n* Decouple services from direct dependence and allow storage of events in a queue\n  * Reliability: if the consuming service goes offline, messages are retained in the queue and can still be processed\n  * A message queue can have a single sender/receiver or multiple senders/receivers\n\n![](imgs/slides369.png)\n\n# Priority queue pattern\n\n* Decouple and prioritize requests sent to services\n  * Requests with a higher priority are received and processed more quickly than those with a lower priority\n  * Useful in applications that offer different service level guarantees\n* Control how and when messages are dealt with\n  * Different queues, topics, or streams to feed messages to your functions\n  * High-priority messages go through expensive services with more capacity\n\n![](imgs/slides370.png)\n\n# That’s all,

access to AWS resources\n  * IAM controls who is authenticated and authorized to use resources\n* IAM user\n  * Unique identity recognized by AWS services and applications\n  * Similar to user in an operating system like Windows or UNIX\n\n* IAM role\n  * Set of policies for making AWS service requests\n  * Trusted entities (e.g., such as IAM users) assume roles\n    * Delegate access with defined permissions to trusted entities\n    * There is no limit to the number of IAM roles a user can assume\n* User vs role\n  * User has permanent long-term credentials and is used to directly interact with AWS services\n  * Role does not have credentials and cannot make direct requests to AWS services\n  * Roles are assumed by authorized entities, such as IAM users\n\n* Alice (i.e., an IAM user) is a firewoman\n  * She is the same person with or without her turnout gear\n  * As a firewoman (i.e., a role)\n    * If she speeds to a house fire and passes a police officer, he isn't going to give her a ticket\n    * In her role as a _firewoman_ , she is allowed to speed to the house fire\n  * As a private citizen (i.e., another role)\n    * When she is off duty, if she speeds past that same police officer, he's going to give her a ticket\n    * In her role as a _private citizen_ , she is not allowed to speed\n\n# AWS\n\n* Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a public-cloud platform\n* Services can be accessed in multiple ways\n  * Web GUI: intuitive point and click access without any programming\n    * Intuitive interfaces is part of the attraction of cloud services\n    * Tedious if the same actions must be performed repeatedly\n  * (REST) Application programming interface (API)\n    * Permits requests to be transmitted via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)\n  * Software

group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable\n  * Each table contains zero or more items\n    * No limit to the number of items you can store in a table\n  * Each item in the table has a unique identifier, or primary key\n  * E.g., in the table `people`, each item represents a `person`\n    * The primary key consists of one attribute (`fiscalCode`)\n\n* Attributes\n  * A data element that is not broken down any further\n    * E.g., an item in the `people` table contains attributes `fiscalCode` and `lastName`\n  * Most of the attributes are scalar (have only one value)\n  * Some of the items have a nested attribute (`address`) up to 32 levels deep\n* Schemaless\n  * Other than the primary key, a table is schemaless\n    * Neither the attributes nor their data types need to be defined beforehand\n    * Each item can have its own distinct attributes\n\n* Primary Key\n  * To create a table, you must specify the primary key of the table\n  * No two items can have the same key\n* Two types of primary keys\n  * Partition key: a simple primary key composed of one attribute (partition key)\n    * Keys are inputs to an internal hash function\n    * The hash function determines the physical partition in which the item will be stored\n    * E.g., access any item in the `people` table directly by providing the `fiscalCode`\n  * Composite primary key: partition key and sort key (two attributes)\n    * First attribute is the partition key\n    * Second attribute is the sort key\n    * Items in same partition key value are stored together and sorted by sort key\n\n![](imgs/slides377.png)\n\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-gsi-overloading.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-gsi-overloading.html)\n\n* Secondary Indexes\n  * One or more secondary indexes per table\n  * Indexes are automatically maintained on add, update, or delete\n  * Query data using an alternate key (additionally to queries against primary key)\n* Two types of indexes\n  * Global secondary has partition and sort keys different from those on table\n  * Local secondary has the same partition key but a different sort key\n  * Each table has a limited quota of 20 global and 5 local indexes\n* How do we shape the schema?\n  *
